# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file configures how GitHub Copilot should assist you in this project. Customize these instructions to match your coding style and project needs.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** [Your project name]
**Description:** [Brief description—e.g., "A to-do list application built with Python, tkinter, and ttkbootstrap"]
**Target Users:** [Who will use this code?—e.g., "Novice Python programmers"]

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python Standards
- [Add your Python style rules—indentation, naming, imports, etc.]
- [Example: "Use snake_case for functions and variables"]
- [Example: "Maximum line length: 88 characters"]

### GUI (tkinter + ttkbootstrap)
- [How should widgets be organized?]
- [Naming conventions for callbacks and event handlers?]
- [How to apply themes and styling?]

## Project Structure

Describe your folder layout:
```
project-root/
├── src/          [Your source code]
├── tests/        [Unit tests]
├── docs/         [Documentation]
└── data/         [Data files, configs, etc.]
```

## When Asking for Help

1. **Be specific:** Describe *what* you want, not just "make this work"
2. **Show context:** Share relevant code snippets
3. **Ask one thing at a time:** Easier to get focused answers
4. **Use the example-prompt-file.prompt.md template:** Structures your request

## Copilot Capabilities in This Project

Copilot can help with:
- ✅ Explaining how code works
- ✅ Generating unit tests
- ✅ Proposing bug fixes
- ✅ Creating new features
- ✅ Code reviews
- ✅ Documentation

Copilot cannot:
- ❌ Run code directly
- ❌ Access external APIs or databases
- ❌ Make permanent decisions about design

## Logging & Documentation

- All interactions are logged to `copilot.log.md`
- Keep comments in code clear and helpful
- Document *why* decisions were made, not just *what* the code does

## Special Instructions

[Add any project-specific rules here—e.g., "Always include error handling," "Use type hints," "Write docstrings for all functions"]
