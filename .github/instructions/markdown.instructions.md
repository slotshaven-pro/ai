# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Use Danish language
- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar
* Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
* Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
* Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
* Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

## Code Examples
- Use fenced code blocks for code snippets.
- Surround code blocks with blank lines.
- If plain text or language is not obvious, use language "bash" after ```

## Lists
- Surround lists with blank lines.

## Markdown Guidelines
- Use headings to organize content.
- Always insert blank line after each heading.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
